* Description
These are my personal dotfiles, which I manage with the help of git and a simple
=Makefile=. This is the base dotfiles repository which contains what I want to
have available in a basic shell environment.

* What is included
** Shell environment
- [[file:zshrc][zshrc]] :: zsh use =antigen= zsh bundle which is reponsible for downloading and
     loading different zsh plugins
- [[file:bashrc][bashrc]] :: bash (not used anymore)
- [[file:toprc][toprc]] :: fancy colors for =top= command

** X11 settings
- [[file:xinitrc][xinitrc]] :: execute =openbox= at start time
- [[file:Xdefaults][Xdefaults]] :: it mainly contains some Xft antialias stuff and define =emacs=
     default font
- [[file:Xmodmap][Xmodmap]] :: switch Caps_Lock with ESCAPE key

** Individual tool configurations
- [[file:gitconfig][gitconfig]] :: =git= mail and name configuration
- [[file:latexmkrc][latexmkrc]] :: setup for =latexmk=

** Application configuration
- [[file:config/openbox/][openbox]] :: =openbox= configuration files
- [[file:config/terminator][terminator]] :: =terminator= terminal
- [[file:config/dunst][dunst]] :: =dunst= notification system (much better than =libnotify=)

** Misc.
- [[file:fonts][fonts]] :: directory that holds additionnal fonts
- [[file:bin][bin]] :: binaries directory

* Installation
Create some directory where to store multiple dotfiles repositories.

Clone this repository into that directory.
